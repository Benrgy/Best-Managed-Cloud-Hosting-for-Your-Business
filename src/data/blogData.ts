## Understanding the Hosting Types

### Shared Hosting Overview
Shared hosting places multiple websites on a single server, sharing resources like CPU, RAM, and storage. It's the most economical hosting option but comes with limitations.

### Managed Hosting Overview
Managed hosting provides dedicated resources with professional management services. Your website gets optimized infrastructure with expert support and maintenance.

## Key Differences Comparison

- Consistent performance regardless of other sites
- SSD storage and advanced caching
- CDN integration for global speed

### Security Features
**Shared Hosting:**

- Shared security vulnerabilities
- Limited SSL options
- Manual backup responsibility

**Managed Hosting:**

- **Personal Blogs**: Non-critical personal websites

### Managed Hosting Ideal For:

## Making the Right Choice

### Consider Shared Hosting If:

5. **Optimization**: Fine-tune performance settings

## Recommendations by Business Type

### E-commerce Businesses

## Conclusion
